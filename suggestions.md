Overall, your code is well-organized and effective for its current scope. The main areas for potential efficiency improvements are:

Caching Firestore Data:
If the leaderboard grows, caching user docs or aggregating scores with batched queries may reduce the number of individual Firestore calls.

Memoization:
Using useMemo for expensive aggregator calculations can prevent unnecessary re‑renders if dependencies (such as placementType) have not changed.

Dependency Arrays:
Review the dependency arrays in your useEffects to ensure that you’re not triggering extra computations. In particular, consider whether including myStandings in the leaderboard effect is necessary.

Code Reusability:
Extract shared logic (such as post‑sign‑in handling and helper functions) into separate utilities or hooks to keep your component code concise.

Implementing these suggestions should help make your code more efficient and maintainable as your project grows.
